Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. — 3-Statement Financial Model

Project Overview

This project develops a fully integrated 3-statement financial model for Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M) using Microsoft Excel.
The model links the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement to analyze historical financial performance and forecast future business outcomes through assumption-driven projections.

The goal of this project is to simulate how financial analysts evaluate company performance, capital allocation, and cash generation in a real-world corporate environment.

All figures are presented in INR Crores unless stated otherwise.

Business Objective

Convert historical financial statements into a structured analytical model

Understand how operational performance flows into cash generation and balance sheet strength

Build forward-looking forecasts aligned with industry realities

Evaluate profitability, leverage, and reinvestment strategy

Model Structure

The model includes:

Cleaned historical financial data (multi-year analysis)

Assumption-driven forecasting framework

Fully linked Income Statement → Balance Sheet → Cash Flow Statement

Automated retained earnings and cash reconciliation

Executive summary dashboard highlighting KPIs and financial trends

Forecasting Approach 

Forecast assumptions were designed to remain realistic rather than aggressive:

Revenue Growth: Based on historical trend and supported by M&M’s strong SUV portfolio and rural tractor demand exposure.

Operating Margins: Kept broadly stable, reflecting pricing discipline and cost control rather than unrealistic expansion.

Capital Expenditure: Modeled as a percentage of revenue to represent continuous investment in manufacturing capacity and EV transition.

Working Capital: Negative working capital structure maintained, consistent with auto industry dealer financing dynamics.

Financing Structure: Debt levels assumed stable, resulting in a balanced capital structure.

Key Analytical Insights

Revenue growth translates into steady profitability without excessive leverage expansion.

Negative working capital improves operating cash flow quality and reduces funding pressure.

Forecast period shows sustainable growth supported by reinvestment rather than debt dependency.

Debt-to-Equity remains close to ~1.0x, indicating moderate and manageable financial leverage.

Cash generation improves over forecast years as operating performance stabilizes.

Challenges Addressed

Building accurate linkages across all three financial statements

Balancing forecast Balance Sheet through correct cash flow integration

Avoiding double counting in CapEx and asset movement

Maintaining simplicity while preserving financial realism
